LLMs Versus Symbolic Computations

The performance of the GPT-3.5 Turbo model is evaluated through its ability to solve complex logical reasoning questions sourced from the LogiQA dataset. This evaluation process involves passing these complex problems to the model via its API and then comparing the solutions generated by GPT-3.5 Turbo against the correct answers provided within the LogiQA dataset. The primary objective of this is to determine the model's proficiency in logical reasoning skills.

The file LLMs_vs_SymbolicComputations.ipynb is the python script required to run this code (API Key should be accessed from OpenAI). The file LLMs_vs_SymbolicComputations_Sample_Run.ipynb is an example of the execution of the code.

This is a sample execution and its important to understand that the results may fluctuate with each execution due to the inherent variability in GPTâ€™s responses. While the results are not consistently precise, they generally tend to show lower accuracy.
